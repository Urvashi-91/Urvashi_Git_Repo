You are given a set of positive numbers and a target sum ‘S’. Each number should be assigned either a ‘+’ or ‘-’ sign.
We need to find the total ways to assign symbols to make the sum of the numbers equal to the target ‘S’.
Input: {1, 1, 2, 3}, S=1
Output: 3
Explanation: The given set has '3' ways to make a sum of '1': {+1-1-2+3} & {-1+1-2+3} & {+1+1+2-3}
Input: {1, 2, 7, 1}, S=9
Output: 2
Explanation: The given set has '2' ways to make a sum of '9': {+1+2+7-1} & {-1+2+7+1}

Explanation:
Now, let’s say ‘Sum(s1)’ denotes the total sum of set ‘s1’, and ‘Sum(s2)’ denotes the total sum of set ‘s2’. 
So the required equation is:

    Sum(s1) - Sum(s2) = S
This equation can be reduced to the subset sum problem. 
Let’s assume that ‘Sum(num)’ denotes the total sum of all the numbers, therefore:

    Sum(s1) + Sum(s2) = Sum(num)
Let’s add the above two equations:

    => Sum(s1) - Sum(s2) + Sum(s1) + Sum(s2) = S + Sum(num)
    => 2 * Sum(s1) =  S + Sum(num)
    => Sum(s1) = (S + Sum(num)) / 2
Which means that one of the set ‘s1’ has a sum equal to (S + Sum(num)) / 2. 
This essentially converts our problem to: 
    "Find the count of subsets of the given numbers whose sum is equal to (S + Sum(num)) / 2"
