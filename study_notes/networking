Q 1: Why would the MAC address be wrong on the default interface on a newly created VM?
A 1: udev rules are incorrectly written -- udev sets process that looks at hardware and sets that hardware up in /dev
     udev uses persistence rules based on the MAC address of the network card. If it has an entry for eth1 with a known MAC address 
     and a card appears with a different MAC address it will allocate a different ethX device name to the interface.
        To counter this, you just need to update the udev rules. 
        Edit:#vi /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules --> and look for the line with your current MAC:
              SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="11:22:33:44:55:66", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
 
Q 2: Does DNS uses TCP?
A 2: DNS uses both TCP and UDP for valid reasons described below. UDP messages aren't larger than 512 Bytes and are truncated when greater than this size. DNS uses TCP for Zone transfer and UDP for name, 
     and queries either regular (primary) or reverse. UDP can be used to exchange small information whereas TCP must be used to exchange information larger than 512 bytes. If a client doesn't get response 
     from DNS, it must retransmit the data using TCP after 3-5 seconds of interval. Consistency is maintained using TCP.DNS uses TCP for Zone transfer and UDP for name, and queries either regular (primary) or reverse.
