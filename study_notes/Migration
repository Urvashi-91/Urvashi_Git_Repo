Migration Phases:

Phase 1: Identify Business goals: Migrating to scale up, reduce cost, improve reliability?
Phase 2: Identify Migration Strategy: Server Migration Service, DB Migration Service, Amazon DirectConnect
Phase 3: Plan Proof Of Concept for a test apps, approvals from Stakeholders and final migration full plan.
Phase 4: Operate apps on AWS and turn off on-premise setup

Migration Strategies:

Strategy 1: Re-host ("Lift and Shift")
Strategy 2: Re-platform ("Lift, tinker and shift")
  - Made changes to some platforms like replacing self-hosted databases to Amazon RDS
  
  

Migration Challenges:

Compute Resiliency: Cloud machine instances dont live forever
  Solution: 1. Opt for Reserved instances
            2. for deployment and availability use Elastic Beanstalk
            3. Active/Standby IPSec tunnels and Amazon DirectConnect to make VPC and your Enterprise network connect.
New Logging and Monitoring Strategy required
  Solution 1. Centralised logging: Use Cloud Watch, Lambda and Cognito
  
Cost Management: Cost was dynamic
  Solution: 1. Used AWS calculator for cost estimate and leveraged KPIs to filter out some components.
  
Security: Apps move from on-premise to cloud hence exposed
  Solution: 1. IAM and KMS to ensure security
