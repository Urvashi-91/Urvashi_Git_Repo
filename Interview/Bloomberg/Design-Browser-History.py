Itâ€™s not difficult to realize that we need a stack so that back can be implemented. 
However, what to do for forward. 
Because you want the ability to visit all pages in the backward as well as the forward direction, we need to store the URLs whenever we go back. 
If you see the order in which we want to visit, you will quickly realize that we need two stacks. One to store history and another to store the next URLs in case we go back.

Two special cases:
You must always have at least one element in the history stack which is the page that you are currently at.
But for the forward stack, this condition is not necessary.

I am sure the following code will make it even clearer.
